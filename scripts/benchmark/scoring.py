"""Scores a benchmark run against the scenario's truth.

Every sample time T (the run's `sample_secs`), the tracks being scored are
compared with where the truth objects are at T:

- GOSPA (Rahmathullah, Garcia-Fernandez and Svensson, 2017), as Stone Soup's
  GOSPAMetric computes it with p = 1 and alpha = 2: an optimal assignment of
  tracks to truths with cutoff c; the distance splits into localisation
  (assigned pairs), missed (truths left over, c/2 each) and false (tracks
  left over, c/2 each). Reported as the mean over T.
- SIAP-style measures (Votruba 2001, as in Stone Soup's SIAPMetrics), with a
  truth and a track associated at T when the GOSPA assignment pairs them:
  completeness (truths with a track), ambiguity (tracks within c of each
  tracked truth), spuriousness (tracks near no truth), position and velocity
  accuracy (RMS), and identity: track number changes per truth hour,
  fragmentation (distinct tracks per truth), longest segment (the share of a
  truth's time held by its longest-held track) and time to first track.
- Correlation, where feeds and sensors report the same objects: at each T,
  every pair of source tracks the engine put on one system track is right
  (same truth) or wrong, and every pair of source tracks of one truth left on
  different system tracks is a missed pairing.

Tracks are dead-reckoned from their last report to T (course and speed, up
to MAX_EXTRAPOLATE_S), as a consumer drawing them would. Truth points marked
`score: false` are don't-care: tracks on them are neither false nor scored.
When the truth is incomplete (`truth_complete: false`: the sensors see
traffic nobody logged), tracks near no truth are counted as unlabelled
instead of false, and spuriousness is not reported. With
`detected_within_m` (real recordings where the sensor saw only some of the
truth), a truth point also counts only when a plot fell within that distance
of it within `detected_window_s`: the tracker is scored on what the sensor
gave it, not on what the sensor missed.
